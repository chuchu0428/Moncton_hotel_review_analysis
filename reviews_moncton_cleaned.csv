One of the two best that I have ever encountered. We stayed in a front first floor room, which meant that we had an interior corridor, but also direct access to the outside and our car parked right in front of the room.  The room itself was well above average, very clean, comfortable, nice bathroom.  The (included) breakfast was quite good.  We can't speak to the WiFi, as we hooked up to our own mobile unit.",4,positive

What a quaint little hotel. We had a walk up room so we had a small porch with a chair and could sit out. The room was extremely clean and comfortable. The beds were very comfy and there was a huge television. The staff was friendly. The hotel is located right off the hiway. There is a free continental breakfast which was your typical but good. We ate dinner in the casino which was directly beside the hotel and the food was actually pretty good. The server there was a bit distracted but efficient.

I though that the price was a little high for this kind of hotel in Moncton NB, but later found out that this was a car show week end, not sure but maybe they put the prices up for that.  I also found it odd that at about 6:30 on my day of arrival I got a phone call asking if we were showing up, the room was booked with a credit card and basically paid for, plus 6:30pm is not like your late? Maybe because it was so busy in Moncton they had people on a wait\u002Fcancellation list?\nEasy enough to find. Outside is nice, I like that some of the rooms have a deck, although it is not private and you do share with the room next to you.   Our shared deck was occupied by the room next to us so we did not use it. Plus it is overlooking a parking lot, so not much to see in that regard.  They have nice flowers and chairs.\nCheck in was fairly easy. \nI did not realize on booking that I had a \""family suite\"" which included a main room and a door less room with a set of bunk beds. This was not required since it was just myself and my 16 year old daughter, however she did sleep in there, she did not find it to be overly comfortable beds. Best suited for younger children, who I am sure would get a kick out of that kind of set up. I though that the main bed was quite comfortable.  The room is lacking in plugs, again probably because it is older, but that could be solved with some docking stations on the night stands. We had multiple electronics and phones, and insufficient places to plug them in. Bring an extension cord. \nThis is an old hotel\u002Fmotel with some drive up rooms which also share hall access with the rest of the hotel. \nIt is VERY clean, well maintained but it is old style hotel, and the furnishes and the flooring and the decor match that, all dated.  I feel like they have made some attempts to update, noting that there are updated TV's, etc. but it is dated. Again I would say that it is VERY clean, pristine really, they really are making an attempt but it is time to bring it into the new century. \nThere is not much direct around here, a couple other hotels, which might have restaurants, but if you were looking for food you would have to drive.  Although not far, just up Mountain Road. It is close to Magic Mountain and the Casino. \nThis hotel also includes breakfast which we did not have. I did appreciate the in suite microwave, bar fridge and coffee machine. \nFound the it noisy in the morning, you can hear every thing and everyone. Above you, next to you, in the hall, outside. NOISY.\nDecent hotel. Clean but dated, but well maintained. \nCheck out was poor. I ended up leaving my keys on the desk, noting that there were other clients being served however no one acknowledged me and after about 10 mins standing there, I just put the key cards down and left. \nI personally would probably not stay here again , the price is too high for a  hotel that basically has no amenities, especially given there is a lot of choice in Moncton including some newer places for similar pricing that just offer more.",3,negative

I booked thru booking.com this time and had no problem whatsoever checking in or checking out.  The electronic key card did not work on the first attempt but the Manager left a meeting she was having to re-scan my card key.

Upon close inspection,the sheets seemed clean but were wrinkled and suspicious looking..as was the coverlet. (unlike the crispness found in Quispamsis) The carpet was stained. The bathroom was clean.\nBreakfast was a huge disappointment. I didn't expect much because it was advertised as \""continental\"", and that's fine. Unfortunately, the only thing offered besides coffee and orange juice was muffins and cinnamon buns. There were 3 muffins and 1\u002F2 a cinnamon bun both of with were so stale they disintegrated on the plate.

My booking was influenced by a sale on a wholesaler website. While the price was right for my wife and I to getaway and enjoy a night away without our child, we were assigned a double bed in an ADA\u002Faccessible room, just off the lobby... in my opinion, one of the worst room types and even worse for a cost-efficient husband taking his wife out for a romantic weekend getaway. Not to mention that our reservation stated we were assigned an \""ocean view\"" room which was a laugh since the hotel is nowhere near the ocean. But please note that the room type (or my own lack of romantic awareness) does not impact this review and my rating the hotel as \""average\"". While the hotel's location is good, the hotel is tightly built on a small lot and the rooms offer nothing interesting in terms of \""view\"" (unless you want to watch the neighbors enjoy an evening bonfire). The hotel\u002Froom was clean and the bed did provide a good sleep albeit tight quarters for two adults in a double bed (especially with a disgruntled wife). I can't comment on the bathroom; while clean, I dislike accessibility bathrooms (but I applaud any hotel's ADA options for guest). However I must mention that the room floor was uneven (as seen in a photo) and while this made my wife and I a little disorientated, I can imagine that this could provide some issues for ADA guest. I can't see this uneven floor being by design, perhaps a building flaw, but I am no engineer\u002Farchitect (nor a \""Casanova\"", according to my wife). The pool area was adequate for kids. The morning breakfast was ok (average selection - scrambled egg, sausage, cereals) but the area was poorly situated as guest standing in line towered over others trying to eat. It was cramped. Front desk staff said only a few words but nothing beyond the check-in task. A smile and acknowledging guest in the lobby would be nice.

After a 'good' stay over a year ago, we decided to stick with familiarity upon our return and give them another shot. To say that this was a disappointment is a colossal understatement. The biggest problem we had this visit was our lack of sleep due to a very cold and noisy room. During the evening we'd asked for assistance figuring out the Atari aged thermostat, but all that left us with was an insanely noisy vent and not any boost in our heat. Between the noise and temperature (and apparent tolerance of drunk people laughing and yelling continuously in the hallway) we barely got a nap's worth of sleep. But the topper was the response we got when we politely mentioned this upon checkout:...wait for it...'If you're not used to it, it can be loud.'. I will note the faint gleam of positivity by mentioning that this sentence was the most that any of the staff said to us in two days. I've worked as a guest service agent for the majority of my hotel career, and I would be ashamed to see the level of customer service absence at a property I worked at. The evening staff in particular not only did not look up or acknowledge people, but barely looked or grunted to my simple 'Hello' while walking by. But overall I'd have to say that the lack of professionalism, manners or anything guest service related was a hideous frame around an already ugly picture, and we are relieved to never have to have such a horrific travel experience again.

What a pleasant surprise to see how wonderful this city is!\n\nThe location on the river of this hotel is very nice as there is a boardwalk as you step out of the hotel.

I really enjoyed the fresh oranges, apples and bananas each day.  I would have appreciated some granola cereal and raisins\u002Fnuts as well.  The upside to breakfast was the friendly staff and especially one lady (wish I could have noticed her name).  That lovely lady worked her proverbial...butt off.  The room for breakfast did not accommodate the number of guests in the hotel at all.  People were forced to take food to their room in order to have a place to sit.  As fast as someone left a table others grabbed it.  The hotel definitely has to work on this.  If breakfast is included so should there be a place to sit and enjoy it.  They also could have used someone to specifically clear and clean the tables as guests were forced to remove their own dishes or if the guest didn't remove their dishes then the next person did which also meant sitting at a dirty table.  Maybe they should consider putting some tables in the lobby area by the fireplace for the overflow.  \n\nI used the fitness area which was fine.  They could use a better treadmill as the rubber belt was loose and slippery.  Actually two good treadmills would do the trick as someone else came in to use the treadmill and left as I had just started my jog.  Also, I could not get the tv working at all, but this would not have mattered if the cardio equipment was facing outside for the view.

The tournament chooses the hotel, not the team, no we had no say in where we stayed. With this in mind we throught the standard policy of leaving early with no cost penalty if your team lost early in the weekend would apply for our rooms. This was not the case.\n\nWith our players not doing so well we approached the desk to let them know that we would be checking out the following morning - a day early - and to ask for our bills. They would not budget on the charge of a half-day room rental for an early departure. Every member of our team was charged this. We have never experienced this with any other hotel on any other tournament in any other city in the years that our children have played hockey. (Our team is 15-18 ear olds so there have been many tournaments over the years)\n\nThis act of bad faith on behalf of our families has caused my family to no longer use Comfort Inn\u002FChoice Hotel Chain unless it is absolutely necessary.\n\nOn top of all of this the room was disgusting. The coffee pot had dried, old coffee on the lid and inside from a previous occupant. There were 2 pieces of hair dried onto the countertop in the bathroom that I had a difficult time removing due to how stuck they were.

There is so many reasons that I gave this hotel 1 star this hotel doesn\u2019t even deserve one star but I can\u2019t give it any less, but let me start from the beginning. So, yesterday (March 6th 2020) we travelled Halifax, Nova Scotia as we\u2019re on our way home but we decided that we were going to stay at the night at the Days inn & suites for the night. So, when we first arrived it was around 2:15pmish, we walked inside and there was a couple of people in the lobby waiting to check in, before we made it up to the counter I overheard some of employees saying that people\u2019s rooms weren\u2019t clean yet which was understandable because check in wasn\u2019t until 3:00pm anyways. We just decided to go do something for the next 40 minutes. When returned back to the hotel it was now probably 3:10pm - 3:15pm we pulled up out front and there was a massive line leading all the way back to the entrance. I did notice on the website earlier though that the hotel had been fully booked, however, the night prior when we booked our room there was plenty left so they must\u2019ve all gotten booked overnight. Instead of waiting in the line we just decided to go back out and do something else for a little bit to wait for the line to go down. We arrived at the hotel now the third time, it was around 3:50pm. The line was still backed up all the way to entrance, we just decided to go in now just in case they chose to give the room away or something. We stood in line for probably 45 minutes to an hour (ridiculous). During this time, other people from the public were butting in front of us because they had \u201Ca pool membership\u201D and they weren\u2019t waiting to get checked in?? Like does it look like care? We were here first take your brats and go stand in the back! In addition, people who were already checked in and had been staying at the hotel already were butting in line to talk to people at the front desk, asking questions and all this. There was also children coming from the pool going to front desk asking questions about towels like omg. Also while we were standing there I could over hear the people at the front desk constantly used a walk-in talkie to talk to the house keeping staff to check the status of rooms, like I kid you not it took at least 10-15 minutes to check each person in!!!! Probably like 90% of the people that \u201Cattempted\u201D to check in were told their rooms were still not clean! They were told to either wait, leave, or go to the express lounge that was just around the corner. Not to mention the annoying little brats running in and out of the hotel, and just pushing right through me like you\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t just trip you! I realize it\u2019s not the hotels job to control what the children are doing, but these parents suck at parenting! It also doesn\u2019t help that the front desk staff was working at the slowest pace ever like they weren\u2019t rushing or anything. There was only 3 employees working at the front desk, the one specifically on the end pissed me off, he was an older gentleman with like grey and glasses. My goodness was he ever slow, he would check one person in and then leave for like 5-10 minutes like where in the world are you going?!?!?!?!? The one we dealt with was trying his best to help us, we stood there for like felt like an eternity because he was trying to get the status of our room, but of course the house keeping staff are slow as hell so that didn\u2019t respond for like 5 minutes after the front desk agent asked the status. When they finally responded an eternity later, our room was STILL NOT CLEAN! The man at the front desk had said he was going to block of a room for us. Before we were about to leave again, we asked about the corporate rate because 1) with our corporate rate you can\u2019t put a number like it allows you to do on the website, ours only has the company name and a photo of the person on the ID 2) We would usually call the front desk to book the room (if you call the 1-800 number it will redirect you to some call centre in the United States and they don\u2019t know what Irving is (the corporate rate we used). When we called the front desk, the man said that there wasn\u2019t any rooms available, when CLEARLY ON THE WEBSITE THERE WAS AT LEAST 10! In the end we ended up just booking it online (we booked the 1 king, one bedroom non smoking, which is where the bedroom and living room are separated by French doors) and we were just going to mention the corporate rate when we arrived. 3) after we told the man at the front desk about the corporate rate, he took a minute and looked it up and stuff and then he comes back with \u201Cthe corporate doesn\u2019t apply because we\u2019re fully booked\u201D and when we asked why it\u2019s because when they are fully booked the company blocks out the corporate rate! There is NOT A SINGLE MENTION OF THIS LITTLE POLICY THEY HAVE ANYWHERE! Anyways we said some words to him, we told him I wasn\u2019t his fault and that the manager should be here during situations like this. Oh yeah I forgot to mention, no manager on duty whatsoever! Like where tf are you? You\u2019re supposed to be running a hotel, and you\u2019re not even there! We asked if there was going to be any compensation and he said that the only way for any of that to go down, we would have to contact the manager. Of course we have to contact the manager, oh wait he\u2019s not here. Anyways, we left there again, and went out once again. We returned now the 4th time at around 5:30, and this time there was no line, I mean there was a couple of people but there was only like a 5 minute wait. However I could still overhear the employees turning people alway still because their rooms still weren\u2019t clean. In addition, they were still using the walkie talkie to communicate with the house keeping staff. About 5:40 we finally spoke to the same man, he searched the computer and said our rooOh m still wasn\u2019t clean, however, there was another one the same as ours that was available and clean! He gave us that one, then he made us sign all the paper work and all this other other stuff. The room was room 253 on the the second floor of I\u2019d say the main building. I can\u2019t believe this it took 4 times to attempt check in! By the time we had made it to our room it was 6:00pm! We walked in and you could just tell that the room was half cleaned. We thought that this was the end of the problems, but we thought wrong. We walked into the bathroom, and you know how there is usually 4 towels and 2 hand towels? Well, we only had 2 towels and 1 hand towel. So, we decided to go back to the front desk to ask for the towels because do you really think they are going to have the time to answer the phone, and house keeping most definitely not! So, we just went down to speak to them face to face, we talked to this one guy he seemed to be nice but was beyond hard to understand. We told him what we needed and he wrote down our room number and what we needed on this 2 paged sheet with columns. There was at least 10 other guests above us on the list that were requesting things as well. We returned to the room and then decided we should go get something to eat, we thought that maybe the hotel staff would just come and let themselves in with the towels, because that\u2019s what house keeping would probably do. About an hour and a half later, we returned and omg big surprise no towels! We decided we were going to go see how many people were in the pool, and then proceed to the front desk to see if the towels were coming anytime soon! We also thought that it would be a good idea to get some ice, we reached for the ice bucked and would you look at that the ice bucket had no bag in it, and there was a puddle of water in the bottom! So, just grabbed cups instead and used those for the ice! So, the pool\u002Fhot tub were full of the children, teens, and adults (we never ended up going in) we then went to the front desk to ask again about the towels. This time we dealt with the grey haired man, he said that they were going to be going around shortly with the list to give people the things the needed. We returned back to our room, and waited once again we thought that this was the end of all the issues. But nope! So, we\u2019re sitting in our room right, and like we\u2019re just relaxing, watching tv, oh and also listening to the brats running up and down and up and down the hallway for a good 45 minutes. You can tell this hotel doesn\u2019t even care about their guests because they didn\u2019t do anything about it! Oh and there parents are ridiculous who suck at their parenting! Hopefully the parents who stayed there last night read this review as well and maybe they\u2019ll update their parenting skills because I\u2019m sorry honey but they suck the way you\u2019re doing them. Anyways,after they finally finished running up and down the hallways, one of the little brats decides to pull the fire alarm! This is when all hell broke loose, people running out of their rooms and screaming I even heard someone say they were leaving their child IN THE ROOM!!!!!!!!!! Anyways we weren\u2019t evacuating by any means, because we knew it was one of the brats that pulled it in the first place!!!! Anyways after about 5-10 minutes of the bell going off. We walked outside the room and the woman in the room next to us said she wasn\u2019t leaving either. Then a few minutes later there was a knock at the door, I looked out the peep hole and thought \u201Comg maybe it\u2019s the towels\u201D!!!!!! But when I opened the door, and looked down the hall it was the man who was hard asf to understand, he turned around when he heard the door open and through his arms up in the air like basically \u201Cwhat are you doing???\u201D I ran back Inside and closed the door and locked it. One of relatives opened the door and then the man start loosing it at us because we weren\u2019t leaving, we told him it was the brats and he asked how wet knew that?! Then we said that the brats we running up and down the halls for like a good hour (not that he cared) then he left us. We closed the door and about 10 minutes later when the fire department finally arrived after like 30 minutes they shut off the alarm! That was that, but still don\u2019t got the towels. For the last time, we called down at like 11:30 we called down to the front desk. The man who was hard asf to understand picked up the phone and we told him we STILL DIDNT HAVE THE TOWELS! He proceeds to say (with sigh before he starts talking) that the house keeping has left and all the towels are gone! We hung up. That was the end of that, we never got the towels. I\u2019m disgusted with all the employees, the house keeping staff and the manager especially. You should be ashamed, and embarrassed the way you run is hotel is absolutely disgusting! You\u2019d do a better job running motel! Oh and Ik you\u2019ll be reading this, so why don\u2019t you leave your contact information so we can have a chat?? If you don\u2019t we will find a way to contact you, since we were only given the numbers for the assistant manager! We will also be speaking with the higher up people of Wyndham! Good Luck ;)! For all future travellers, plz I beg of you don\u2019t stay here! We will never be returning and this place won\u2019t last like this! :(",1,negative

We called while driving to see of any were available and we were given the Hockey Suite. Get this one of you can. It is huge. When I asked the difference in price from a regular suite to the kids suite I was told that out room was $169 and the suite was $229 but they would give it to us for $199. I did not ask for a deal, they just immediately offered. So, off to a good start. \n\nIt is right off the highway, so the location is great. Casino is a walk across the street. Great location. \n\nTh hockey suite is huge and overlooks the pool. The pool closes at 11 and the glass is thick enough that late swimmers are not an impediment to sleeping toddlers. There was no closet in this room which wa strange. There was enough I space to throw our stuff around but a closet would have been neater and better fr the clothes we brought for the wedding.  The kids suite stuff is great. Play station, hockey net, bunk beds and fun decorations. \n\nThe service was outstanding at every turn. Couple of specifics. Getting ready for the wedding, our 5-yr old decided to grab the iron and got a nasty burn. The staff came running with burn cream, bandages and generally cared that he was well seen to. Family members that were down the hall whom we spent a lot of time with left a bag in their room. The house keeper saw us and recognized that we knew each other and made sure we got the bag for our family. \n\nIf not for two things, the review would have been 5's across the board. \n\n1. The pool is so heavily chlorinated that is it hard to get the pool smell offs you or your bathing suit. \n\n2. The breakfast line after 8 AM is long. The breakfast itself is okay but not worth 30 minute wait with no place to sit. \n\nWould definitely stay there again. ",4,positive

I can see how 8-10 year old boys would have loved this room.. there's a long hallway when you enter the room with a hockey net where they can play hockey. There is a separate room with bunk beds & video games which i obviously didn't use, the main queen bed was very comfortable. The room also overlooks the swimming pool. Everything was very clean & surprisingly in good shape considering the amount of wild kids that have likely passed through.

The only complaint about this area is the door requires you room key to be swiped but it would take several attempts to get the door to open or another guest was have to open the door from the inside because you would be swiping so many times.

I'm not sure why this was as we paid the same price for both rooms which were identical on paper. We were also in different buildings which may have had something to do with it.

This needs to be fixed as I have noted other Trip advisors have also pointed this problem out. The $100 hold on my credit card for \""incidentials\"" is\u002Fwas a concern since with this hold you can not use this money as there is a hold on it the duration of your stay.  Thankfully,  I have a high credit limit, most people do not. There has to be a better way to do this before they end up souring people on frequenting their hotel.",3,negative

Every time I've stayed here this year (4 times... once each season) there has been a lineup out the door to check in and an excuse of 'we don't have enough cleaning staff today'. One time there was a 3 hour wait for the room! \n\nThe previous GSM kept me returning-- she would be out front talking with guests, calming their anxieties, helping the front desk staff, and communicating with cleaning staff (when I stayed in Aug she even mentioned she would be staying into the evening to help with laundry). Having worked in a hotel I admired that and could see how hard she was trying. Sadly there was a management change over in the winter that is causing me to RUN.\n\nI could look past the old decor, musty smell, and dark hallways. What I couldn't look past was the lack of customer service and cancelled reservations with NO offer for help just \""Sorry, there's nothing we can do\"" (and yes, I called to confirm my booking and the rooms were just not there and I got the \""nothing we can do line\"" so I asked if there were still rooms available and they responded with 'yes, there are' so I rebooked and again called a week later and they were gone again).",1,negative

I did notice that the grout had seen better days so my opinion of the bathroom was that it was clearly in need of an upgrade.  Will Marriott do it?  Ask them.\n\nNow, all that being said, I don't want to leave fellow travelers with  a poor opinion of this hotel.  It was quite comfortable and safe for the $130 paid.  There is a gym and pool on premises as well and, of course, the WIFI internet is free as well.  Spotty but free nonetheless.\n\nThere is a restaurant on site with a breakfast buffet for $16.95 which I've always thought was a little pricey for breakfast.

The bathroom also had a fairly long hair on the toilet tank. The rest of the room was clean with the exception of the filters in the a\u002Fc unit; they were clogged with dust. A quick rinse in the sink and a blast with the hair dryer to dry them off and they were good as new.

One of the bath towels was completely coming apart at one edge; something that obviously should have been caught by someone in housekeeping a long time ago and thrown out. I\u2019ve stayed in cheap two star motels before and have never come across a towel in that poor condition. The bathroom door had quite a few paint chips and the tub had a few chips in the enamel. \n\nOther than the aforementioned issues, the room was great with a comfy bed, a big tv, a mini fridge, a large desk and a small table specifically designed for eating while sitting on the sofa.

Honestly there was a dropoff but it was really good service.  The front desk staff often drove these vans too, as these airports are not really busy.  It was about five minutes ride to the hotel from Moncton airport.   There was no in-site restaurant, as of most Fairfield Inn, but the front desk staffs have lots of delivery options and if you google online, you will find other options too.  I ended up ordering delivery from a nearby Japanese restaurant through a Canadian delivery app.  However, I don't think there were any restaurants within walking distance.  \n\nThe room was very spacious and the design was very similar to Courtyard concept.  In some ways, there is little difference despite Fairfield Inn is supposed to be a lower grade.  I am sure that their breakfast (too early for me to catch) was a bit less than Courtyard.

So new that it still has the new hotel smell.\n\nWe arrived after dark and the entrance to Marriott Drive is difficult to negotiate in the dark as there are no street lights.\nWe had booked a king suite with one king and a pull out sofa. Both beds were comfortable. Our room had two televisions, but because they were only separated by about four of five feet it was impractical to have two televisions on at the same time. There was no tub in the bathroom but a very large shower. There was lots of seating at breakfast and the food was typical Fairfield Inn fare. For the most part Fairfield Inns are pretty standardized, and this was no exception. As people have mentioned previously the pool is very small, but still it was nice to have the option to go to the pool. I suspect that the pool is much busier on weekends than week days.\n\nThere were a few quirky things though. \nThe room thermostat only displayed imperial measurements, not metric. I had to break out a calculator to figure out what temperature to set the room before going to bed. Note to manager...if you pop off the front panel....look at the top right hand corner of the circuit board, you will see three pins and a F\u002FC mark. Change the black jumper from pins one and two to pins two and three and the thermostat will reset for metric.\n\nAnother odd thing was the clock radio. Marriott has preselected the radio stations that it wants me to listen to. Sadly, none of them were what i wanted to hear. The are four radio options and it appears that they cannot be changed. I needed to listen to an interview on CBC radio while I was there, and was forced to go out to my car to listen to it.\n\nThe hotel is handy to the airport and has a shuttle available.

Kids that were staying there loved the waffles (and the extra's that they could add). We liked being able to get free coffee 24 hrs a day. The pool was small and heavily used by kids. (Waterslide). Wish that they would have had a hot tub\u002Fsauna for the adults!! A great place for families. Its next to the Veterans Highway going into Moncton ( a few minutes to the Mall or downtown).",5,positive

The lobby is large and spacious.  Our room was a suite and you enter the bedroom area when you first walk in.  The sitting area is separated from the sleeping area by a half wall.

These stains did detract from the otherwise beautifully appointed space.\n\nThe bed was very comfortable and we slept well and everything seemed nice and clean.  The bathroom is the first spot you encounter upon entering.  Since the hotel is only two years old everything seemed nice and new.  There was a large walk in shower with glass doors.

The glass doors did not steam up when we showered and we are still puzzling that as the vent in the bathroom didn\u2019t seem large enough to handle all of the shower steam.  One criticism was that the facial tissues provided were very scratchy - the lead housekeeper might look into a better quality brand for their guests.\n\nInternet in the room is limited to three devices but we were able to obtain a code from the nice team at reception (Marriott Gold) to get our last device on line.  The limit of three is more than enough for one person but not the best if there are two or more people in the room.\n\nBreakfast was exactly as I would expect from a Fairfield Inn.

Similarly, they didn't have one-time-use shampoo, but bottles in the shower, like I've seen in an increasing number of places, and which I certainly support.\n\nIt would be nicer if it had a pool and\u002For free breakfast, but that may be asking a lot for a hotel like this that seems to cater to more of a business clientele.\n\nI was surprised by the driveway to the hotel, as it was in worse shape that I would expect, but it is early in spring in Canada, so maybe my expectations are unreasonable :)",4,positive

The bathtub drain would not drain properly so you were standing in several inches of water while showering. \nThe housekeeping department refused to take our breakfast tray down. They actually had to move the tray to enter our room but still left it sitting there.  One of the two housekeepers was actually rude to one of us, telling us we were not using the doorknob sign correctly. We had put the make up room sign out so they wouldn't leave the floor without making up our room. When they knocked they were asked if they could come back in  10 minutes as we would be leaving the room at that time. We were told you only put it out if you want the room made up immediately. This was said in a not very pleasant tone. \nThere was also a misunderstanding about the price of the room and breakfast.

When we checked in and mentioned that we were celebrating our 44th wedding anniversary, they put us in a top floor king suite because it would be quieter.  The room was fantastic, huge and so very comfortable.  We didn't realize what a huge favor that was until we later experienced a massive amount of kids staying in the hotel,  running everywhere and even riding scooters down the hallway.  They camped out near the popcorn machines and goggled it up as fast as the staff could pop it, and we heard other adults comment that getting any popcorn was an impossibility.  Of course none of that is the fault of the staff or hotel, but rather the parents who didn't bother to keep an eye on their children.  \n\nEvery time we needed suggestions or help from the front desk, either Vincient or Matthiew came through for us. When we arrived late and were tired on our anniversary, we asked for a suggestion of somewhere to go for a nice steak dinner but not far away.  Their suggestion of \""Moxie's Classic Grill\"" was spot on!  We had a delightful anniversary dinner there.  \n\nThe business center in this hotel is well maintained and located quietly behind the front desk.  There is a nice area also there where we could purchase a variety of  snacks and  even a few microwave meals were available, if someone wanted them.\n\nThe breakfast at this hotel was amazing, with everything from waffles with various toppings including whip cream, eggs, beans, sausage, bacon or ham, hot and cold cereals, delicious muffins, a variety of fruit, breads, and beverages.

Our shower was not cleaned properly. There was hair on the shower floor and walls that didn't belong to us. Which grosses me out.

The room was quite large, with a very comfy king bed (and about 16 pillows), decorated in quality and style. The washroom was impressively large and it was gorgeous, with a huge, tiled standing shower area. We appreciated all of the \""extras\"", too...including the locally-made Olivier soaps & toiletries. In addition, because we were staying during the day of a large concert, we were offered a complimentary valet service should we have issues finding a convenient parking space after returning from a day of sightseeing.\n\nAfter the concert, we noticed that several of the younger attendants had booked what seemed to be the entire floor above us. However, we didn't experience any issues with noise or rowdiness as we retreated to our room for the night. \n\nOur only real complaint was the buffet breakfast. Although the selections were plentiful, the quality of the food itself left a little to be desired.

The nachos were really good! They came served in a pub style red basket and weren't fancy but super tasty. Our food came on fancy plates and looked like something out of a very fancy restaurant. My boyfriend ordered the ribs and I ordered a tenderloin steak. My boyfriend said the ribs were so so. My steak was DISGUSTING! I am not a very picky eater but wow...I know tenderloin has more fat then most steak but eww....this was like 90% fat...maybe 4 bites of meat off it. I told the weirdo server and she offered me a strip loin instead. I accepted and waited 15 minutes for my med-rare stake while my boyfriends food got cold as we waited. The strip lion was just as bad...didn't have much fat but was cooked as a rare. I took a few bites and my stomach started twisting. I set my fork and knife down right away and she asked how it was. I told her it wasn't very good at all. She took it away apologizing in a strange accent. I had an upset stomach for the rest of the evening.

This reservation included $20.00 in reward Bonus Bucks each and one free Buffet each during our stay.

I've been to Vegas well over a dozen times and stayed in many of their luxury and mid-range hotels.  \n\nI'm in their basic room and it's very large, tastefully furnished and comfortable.  Decor is modern but without feeling cold.  There is a Keurig, five coffee choices and one tea.  Milk and creamers are in the mini fridge.  It's not a mini bar which is great to have so I can use it to keep the room service leftovers cold.  \n\nThe bed is super comfy but not luxury, silky smooth,  really high thread count sheets (300 is what is used here).  By no means cheap bedding though.  Bedding was all clean and fresh smelling with white duvets.  Lots of soft fluffy pillows!  \n\nBathroom has a nice large quartz type counter, makeup mirror a full mirror.  Toiletries were of a good quality and without over powering scents.  They were a bit feminine smelling though so guys staying might take note of that.\nThe shower is huge.  I mean really huge.  Seriously, you could wash a house in it.  My only complaint though is the lack of a tub.  Only the higher tier suites have them.\n\nLots of outlets and lighting is good if you need to get some work done.  Internet could be slow at times but mostly ok.  I did find it harder to catch a good signal in some areas on the room though (rm 410).\n\nHallways are super wide and carpets looked clean.  Staff passing by always said hi and I noticed security walking corridors.\n\nThe pool area isn't huge but is quite inviting.  \n\nI had a spa treatment and it was nicely done and therapist very kind.  Small waiting area to relax in but if there are others there, you're kind of all in each other's face.   There is a selection of waters, teas and coffees as well as apples to enjoy before or after treatments.  Locker room is clean but there was only shampoo, conditioner and body wash in one of the two showers.\nRobes were very comfy and spa sandals had great grip if you wanted to wear them as shower shoes.  Lots of fresh towels available too.\n\nRoom service was quick and the focaccia club was huge and delicious.  The down was the drink I ordered came in sticky glass with fingerprints.\n\nDoes this give a taste of Vegas?  The casino size I'd say more of a morsel.  Room wise though it fairs well.  Is our like the Venetian or Signature rooms? No.  But it rates very well with properties like say Harrahs, MGM or TI and is larger room size than you get in done some of those.\n\nI am enjoying my stay and will come back for sure.  Might have to head for the brunch buffet before leaving in the morning.  :)\n",4,positive

We were beyond excited to spend our honeymoon there, and couldn't wait to check it out! Two nights before, I called to confirm which the price, etc. I was told they had booked us for a different, more expensive suite. I let the agent know that we had booked the Luxury suite, and she said she had fixed it. When we first arrived at the hotel, we noticed the parking lot was JAMMED full. We struggled to find a spot anywhere near the hotel. We checked in and were a tiny bit disappointed that no one even said \""congratulations on your wedding!\"" Even though we had told them it was our honeymoon. Not a huge deal though. \n\nWe checked in and got our vouchers for the casino, which we part extra for to be included with our hotel rate (Xtreme Players Pack or something). We brought the vouchers to the Casino, and were informed that the only way to use the \""vouchers\"" is in ten dollar tickets. We received all the tickets (which had obviously been used a number of times; they were filthy and gross) and started playing. Immediately, the majority of them didn't work.The machines ate 30$ in vouchers! We brought them back to the agent at the Casino, who said it was our fault that they didn't work because we \""bent\"" them. They had already been bent when we got them! Finally, he agreed to put the money on my husbands casino card, and made me a card as well. When we tried to use that, we discovered only one of us could play at a time, so we couldn't even sit side by side and enjoy the casino. We went back to the agent at the casino, who shrugged and say, \""nothing I can do, I don't issue those vouchers!\"" Disappointed, we went back to our room and called the front desk manager at the hotel. He offered to give us a small discount on our hotel room. That was fine. \n\nThat night, we looked out from the balcony and noticed another car parked extremely close to ours. The next morning, we saw that this car had smashed our car with it's door! Not just a tap, but a HUGE dent in our door. We immediately went to the front desk and they took all our information and said they would look right into it! Hours later, we had heard nothing so we called. What security had find was \""inconclusive\"". They claimed that although they could see the car and the people damaging our car, they couldn't see the licence place. Now this is a HUGE safety concern for me. Goodness forbid that there was a violent crime committed in the parking lot (it's HUGE and has hardly any light), there is nothing anyone could do. \n\nFinally, to top it all off, when we left, we were charged the wrong rate. I emailed Julien, the front desk manager right away to let him know this happened (along with how disappointed we were with our stay) and he said that I could call the security team if I wanted to. I did let him know that I had already done that, and the front desk let me know the results and that we had been charged the wrong rate. He emailed me back saying it was my fault I was charged the wrong rate, and to speak to the security team (which I explained numerous times I had already done.) I let him know I wasn't happy with that explanation. In all, we had to pay over 200$ to have the car fixed, and we were charged over 65$ extra for the room we didn't want. He didn't respond. (And still hasn't, over two weeks later!)\n\nTLDR: We booked her for our honeymoon, we paid extra for vouchers for the casino which didn't work (we lost 30$ on that!) Someone smashed our car with their car door, the security team at the hotel claimed they couldn't see the licence plate on that car. We were charged for the wrong hotel room and ended up paying 65$+ extra on it. The front desk manager gave a generic sorry and then refused to respond to any further communication about the whole situation.",1,negative

I had to move an end table to charge my phone. The 3.5ft desk had to hold the coffee maker since there was no other flat surface with an outlet.

But the showers are amazing, so if I had a regular room, I'm sure I would have been just as pleased. \n\nThey only have balconies on the 5th floor suites, which is one of my pet peeves that more hotels don't have balconies in suite rooms, (because along with tubs, I love a terrace!) but it being December and all, I didn't really need one. Totally not a deal breaker (as I know most hotels don't have any balconies period), but for it being a casino, more adult orientated, I figured there would be more balconies. \n\nThe hotel has a pool and hot tub which we took advantage of.

The rooms are very nice, with lots of rooms and a nice single serving coffee maker. The beds were comfortable. The only thing I didn't like about the rooms were the designs of the shower.

It's new and 'new' still shows. Its also a sprawling property. Its a very long walk (indoors, but long) from the hotel to the casino\u002Frestaurant. Unfortunately, the most memorable part of our stay at this hotel was the fact that it lost our reservation and the subsequent trouble we had to go through, just have a place to stay for the night. The hotel also lost a reservation for one of my colleagues who was in Moncton for the same function as we were. Customer service at the front desk was deplorable. It took over an hour before we got a room. Shortly afterward, we were given an upgrade, I suppose as an olive branch for the reservation mix up, but the 'suite' we were given was just extra empty space. There is no mini bar or snack foods in the room. Just an empty fridge and a keurig style coffee machine. I can't complain about the bed though...it was very comfortable! There was no breakfast included in spite of the steep cost for the room, so we had to pay extra for the buffet breakfast. It had a huge VERY SLOW line to get in (thanks to an all-too-chatty cashier). Most of the food was basic, found on any buffet but I have to single out the bacon..it was about the worst I've ever encountered. Oh, and this is not a family place. The buffet is inside the casino...minors are not allowed in. \n\nThe best part of this stay was leaving the buffet. I dropped a $5 bill in a machine on the way out and left with $80 in my pocket. That helped to polish an otherwise unspectacular stay.\n\nThere are many less expensive places to stay in Moncton, and we'll definitely choose one of them on the next trip.

It was easy enough to find the hotel but there are no signs to indicate where the front of the hotel is.  We parked the car and went inside where you had to look around to find the front desk.  We arrived around 1:30 and our room was not ready, which was ok as we had errands to run. We checked in and provided all of our info so when we returned we would just have to pick up our keys.\nWe arrived back at 3:10 to be told our room was clean but needed to be checked.  Not sure what needed to be checked but it took 20 minutes to check it.  We had reserved a suite on the 5th floor.  My husband and I went to the room and proceeded to get changed to go out to the casino for the evening. Imagine my husband's surprise when he came out of the washroom to find another couple standing in our entry way.  The hotel desk had given room keys to another couple to our room.  The couple were kind and left to go down to the front desk to find out what happened.  I was concerned as I was hesitant to stay the night as I didn't want people to access our room as we had expensive items in our room.  The front desk assured us that it would not happen again.  They did provide us with $40 off our bill.\nNow for the room itself, the room was clean but for being a new hotel it was not well thought out and was showing signs of age already.  Our bathroom had a large soaker tub that was very difficult to get into as it was very deep, a step would of helped. In addition there was a door stop right in front of the tub in the very middle so you could only crawl into the tub from the front end.  The shower had a large moldy line going from the turn on valve almost down to the floor.  There is only one small towel rack in the bathroom and it is behind the tub, when showering there is no place to hang your towel so you can access it when getting out of the shower.  There is no guest directory in the room at all and when we inquired at the front desk we were told that it was a paperless hotel (which is fine) and that all the information was on on the hotel channel on the tv.  This is a great idea but one that should be conveyed to guests when arriving so they know where they are able to find the information.  Our room had a patio door which was great but there are no screens on the door, it wasn't a problem during our stay but during the summer there is nothing to keep the bugs out if you wish to keep the door open.  \nThe room did have it's good points as it was very clean and quiet.  The bed was very comfortable but beware the bed frame came almost to the edge of the mattress and I stubbed my toe at least 3 times on the frame.\nThe hotel staff were very friendly and were very helpful.\nWould I stay here again, I am not so sure as I have an issue with the security.

First night was fine as we only got in late. We were served by Sherry who is very friendly and gives great customer service. She was the best thing about our stay. The next night was a nightmare. I was in full blown labor at the hospital and my husband was obviously by my side. We asked his parents to stay the night with our 7year old at the motel. Around 3am the room door opened and a couple of men entered the room!!!!! Needless to say it scared the crap out of my in laws and especially my son. Imagine being woken up by strangers in a strange environment... For a kid that is very scary especially when your mom and dad are not there! After they realized someone was in the room they left and not long after there was loud noises (shouting, footsteps, music etc) and it lasted until the morning. My son was crying the next day at the hospital saying he never ever wanted to sleep at another motel or with anyone besides us because he was scared ALL night and didn't get any sleep. The next morning they told the woman at the desk (not sherry), who said she had made the mistake and double booked the room. All she said was a dry sorry. My in laws were shocked. When we got out of the hospital my husband called and asked for the manager but we got the number of the owner up in Toronto instead. My husband called him and and he said he'd get to the bottom of it and get back to him in 2 days. Never heard back from him so after a week my husband called him  again and again until he finally answered and said he was coming down to Moncton and he would meet up with him the following week. The following week came and the day he said he'd contact us came and went again so my husband called a few days after but he was always in meetings or taking phone calls and he never bothered to call us back after any of those. Sherry was very understanding and nice during that time and kept reassuring my husband that he was not ignoring us (personally We think he was). Well the very last day he was in Moncton we happened to be in town at the hospital so after he did not return our calls all week my husband went straight to there to find him. After all of this the best he could do was give us $30 dollars off (we paid $115). He spent more time trying to explain why it happened than being sorry it happened. Had it been just us adults we would have complained and moved on but the fact that it gave our son such a scare that now he won't want to sleep anywhere and will want to avoid motels! Not to mention the motel was hardly full so there were plenty of other rooms available. This mistake is not just a small one and should NOT happen. It was insulting to not have our calls returned by the owner after he told us he would. If he didn't want to he should have said so and not lied or just dismissed us like we were not worth his time. That says a lot about him. We were extremely nice to him all the way through and never got angry or rude or anything like that. Had we been treated better, I would have given a great review for the way the situation was handled but unfortunately I'm not able to do that. This is the worst experience in a motel\u002Fhotel we or anyone close to us have ever had and $30 off is a joke. Before giving us that offer, he offered to give us another nights stay half price.. Like are you kidding me? Maybe if it would have been in another town where we could have taken a mini vacation out of it we would have considered but we will never go back there again because of the horrible experience and also for the fact that it's too close to home for us. Our stay there was because we needed to be close to the hospital the first night and the second night to have my son close by after birth and to provide him with a pool to occupy his time during the day.",1,negative

The pool was nice and roomy to accommodate more than one family. My only issue was that I chose this hotel by looking at the pool and the fact that breakfast was included. We didn't get breakfast at all. We arrived in the dining room at 8:30am our first morning there and found only one muffin and some spilled cereal left. It is my understanding that a large tour bus had been there, but items should have been replenished for other guests as our party of 7 now had to make other arrangements. As we were not going to be up at the crack of dawn, we didn't even attempt to find food there the next two mornings which added considerable cost to our already pricey vacation (especially since we expected breakfast to be included).

However, when we checked in we were told that the only available room was $89.95. No big deal, we had not booked in advance and it was only $10. On going to the room, the first thing we noted was that the step was a good 12 inches off the ground. I looked like a perfect place to break an ankle. My wife has mobility problems and this caused concern but she managed. The room itself was clean but filled with evidence of badly done renovations such as holes in the wall, badly fitted door trim and switches that did nothing. As the evening went on we realized that there were only 6 or seven other cars in the parking lot so the statement that they were booked up at the $79.95 rate was exposed as a lie. Its not the $10, I just don't like being lied to. In the morning I went to have a shower and found that the shower head was only about 5 1\u002F2 feet high so in order to wash the hair on my 6 foot from the ground head I had to experiment with being a circus performer. There were also no handrails to assist anyone with any kind of handicap. The final insult was that there was only enough regular coffee to make one cup in the morning. They knew there were two of us. Would it be too much to ask that each of us be able to have a coffee in the morning? All in all this place was disappointing in ways that could be easily remedied. If this is typical of the Howard Johnson chain then I would suggest that they need to improve their franchise inspections.",3,negative

The first thing I will say is that the location is great. Very close to downtown on a very quiet street in Moncton. There is even a Sobeys and Shoppers Drug Mart close by!\nI booked this place based on the reviews from TripAdvisor, and while they weren't all stellar reviews, the pictures made it look like a clean, safe overnight stop. Well, as usual the pictures are a little deceiving. The outside of the motel could use a little cleaning up (paint etc) that would go a long way to bettering most reviews. I think the rooms themselves were clean enough, and yes the bathrooms were pretty worn and dated but this isn't a new motel and most of us aren't booking rooms to sleep in the bathroom. Having said that, there was something about this place that just made you feel like it was dirty. Again, the rooms are clean and very nicely decorated but it doesn't FEEL clean...I'm not sure what it is...As a bonus though, I'm pretty sure we just had basic rooms but they both had a little kitchenette in them if you need to keep stuff cold or have things you need to clean. The motel also has a washer and drier available if you need to do any laundry!\nThe only other complaint I have and this is not really a reflection on the quality of the stay is that it is a motel and as such your pull your car up outside of your room...as does everyone else...which makes it VERY loud as everyone is coming and going. It is by no means a quiet motel.Cars coming and going and slamming doors did not make for a peaceful sleep. As well, my room had a adjoining door to the room next door and it was not very soundproof as I could hear my neighbour conversing with her guests, walking across her floor, leaving at 11:00pm to go to the bar, coming back at 2:00am from the bar, and well...having herself a \""good time\"" by herself at 2:30am. Needless to say I didn't get a lot of sleep that night. Again though, this is not the motels fault so much as my neighbours fault who apparently has no respect for those around her. \nWe stayed at the Midtown Motel & Suties in late June and as such the rate was $69.99 and I would not pay any more than this for a room. If you just need a place to lay your head down than this place is more than suitable. If you're looking for 4 star accomodations than look elsewhere...although you will pay for it. I looked at every hotel in the Moncton and the prices are fairly ridiculous. \nOn a side note, I will agree with many other TripAdvisor reviewers and say that Jude (the owner) is THE NICEST, friendliest man in this business. If nothing else his smiling face made up for anything else that was wrong with this motel.",3,negative

We stayed there back in January 2012 while we were in town to see the Canadian Figure Skating Championships. When I planned the trip I was looking for the cheapest way to do everything and this hotel was the cheapest option available. My husband and I aren't too picky about hotels. As long as we have a clean bed to sleep in and the room doesn't reek of cigarette smoke than we're happy. So because this was the cheapest option available we weren't expecting much to begin with. Needless to say we were pleasantly surprised, because I think what we got was worth much more than what we paid. We arrived around 11:00pm because our flight into Moncton didn't land until 10ish. We didn't realize that the office closed at 10, so we were a little nervous when we got to the hotel and realized that no one was around for us to check in with. We rang the bell by the office and the owner\u002Fmanager (not sure if he owns or manages the place - or both) came down to let us into our room. He was incredibly friendly when we apologized for not realizing that we were going to arrive after the office closed. A few weeks earlier we had called to add an extra day onto our trip and from our phone number he realized we were coming in from the states, so when we didn't show up before 10:00, he told us that he had just assumed our flight was getting in pretty late, so it was no problem that we hadn't forewarned him that would be be late.\n\nHe opened the office to run our credit card and he asked us if we wanted to upgrade our room. We said no - we still just wanted the cheapest option, but he ended up upgrading us for free. We had a room reserved in the main building initially, but he upgraded us to the king bed suite in the house in front of the main building. I'm pretty sure we were the only people who were in that entire building which was nice. The room had a living room area, small kitchen with plates and utensils and a small breakfast nook. He walked us to our room, showed us how to work the TV and then gave us some tips on the town. He pointed out where the grocery store was and suggested a local diner for breakfast. Honestly, for it being so late at night, I think this went above and beyond what any other hotel would have done. I've never been walked to my room before and then given tips on where to go in town. It was also pretty icy outside, so after he made sure that we didn't slip as we were walking up the steps into the building, he came back with salt to put on the ice so we wouldn't slip in the morning.\n\nThe room itself was very clean, and we ran into the maid one day as we were getting ready to leave. She was also very, very friendly and gave us some suggestions on things to do and see in town.\n\nOverall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Midtown Motel and if we ever go back to Moncton, we will definitely stay here again. I read somewhere that Moncton was voted the friendliest city in Canada a few years ago and based on our experience here, I can definitely believe that!",5,positive

Sure, it was a good price, but the $79.00 a night he quoted was for ONE person and had to pay $10.00 for my friend (so not such a good price if more than 1 or 2 people).  Who in the heck charges for one person and charges extra for another.  So a couple would have to pay an extra $10.00 for their spouse????? Kids????? CRAZY!!!!!!  Then I could not make it and so another person could go instead of me and he wanted to charge me $10.00 for that other person.  I told him that it was not 3 people, just 2 as I could not go anymore.  He screamed at me and said that he would not stand in front of our hotel door all night to see who was there.  So I told him that is why I called, to say I could not make it and another friend would, so it remains 2 people.  Well he would not let that other person go unless I paid the $10.00 for an \""extra person\"".  Now, 2 minus 1 plus 1 still equals 2 right??????  So why the extra $10.00.  The rooms were not nice at all, dirty and smelly (don't want to talk about it as it makes me want to vomit).  When I called to voice my concerns, he hung up on me.  I had called 30 minutes after getting the room (after finding out about the extra $10.00 for a 3rd person, which would only be 2) to cancel and he would not give us our money back.   I WOULD NEVER EVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO MY WORSE ENEMY!!!!!!!   They are thief's!!!!!  Worse customer service I have ever had.  I WILL pay extra at another hotel before I ever touch foot in that place again.  And I can go on, but it's just getting me to upset just thinking about that place.  Travelers, beware of this place.  Pay the extra for a nice, clean, respectable hotel.  So in a nut shell, $79.00 is not a good price anymore unless you are ALONE.

I've paid more at other hotels in the past and never went back.\n\nWell we went back to Midtown on our return trip, that's how great this place is.

A box TV with terrible reception.  The slowest wifi internet I have ever seen.  Very very noisy - there was some very loud metalic banging sound from just outside my room that happened once an hour throughout the entire night - like a dumpster lid being slammed or something like that.  Very annoying and hard to ignore.

The greeting you will receive is very friendly and helpful. My room was modern and large. One serious complaint is the lighting. There are no sheer curtains to go with the heavy ones. Therefore, you have to choose between a dark room and being seen by everyone walking by. In addition, there is no light near the area where you can prepare food (sink, counter, fridge, microwave) so good luck with that. The fridge was so loud that I had to run it on high during the day and turn it off at night.\n\nThe TV is way too small (19\u201D CRT?) for the room. You get no printed guide, but there is one on-screen. They offer digital TV so you get a lot of channels. The bathroom is a good size, but there isn\u2019t enough counter space. The water was barely hot enough during my stay.\n\nMy main complaint is that they offer no breakfast even though they have an attached bar that would serve as a breakfast nook. The nice restaurant down the street that they will send you to will add $10-$12 onto the cost of your stay and subtract an hour from your day. Plenty of motels in New Brunswick at this price level give you some kind of breakfast, and Midtown should, too.\n\nStill, given the charming hosts, the pleasant locale, and nice rooms for this price, I do recommend you stay here.\n\nScooper47\u2019s top tips: 1. Bring your own breakfast and save that restaurant down the street for lunch or dinner \u2013 but only if you like \u201Cdown-home\u201D cooking and friendly, informal service.\n\n2. The time given for the tidal bore is approximate and can be off by 30 minutes either way. Try to be there for a full or new moon when the tide is strongest.\n\n3. From this motel, you are less than a one-hour drive from Hopewell Rocks. If you miss this park, you will have made the worst mistake of your life.

They are suites (as I believe is normal with the Residence Inn chain). The suites I've been in all have a cooktop, full-size fridge and dishwasher, with a full set of pots and pans, utensils and plates\u002Fbowls. Oversized work desk, and couch and chair area with a large flat-screen that swivels to either the living room area, or bedroom. Very comfortable king-size beds - closest thing I've found in a hotel to sleeping at home. Bathrooms have walk-in showers, and large vanity. Cleanliness in all of my rooms over the last couple of years has been top-notch as well. The rooms are also currently being redesigned one floor at a time - not that they really needed it in my opinion, but you can tell the hotel and chain is really doing it's best to keep the place in good shape and up-to-date.\n\nThe hotel comes with a hot breakfast, which always includes scrambled eggs, and depending on the day, sometimes includes turkey bacon, potato pancakes, regular pancakes, sausages (not so great I hear) and occasionally includes breakfast sandwiches. They also usually have a bowl of some kind of fresh fruit, and apples and bananas. They also have bread, bagels and muffins, yogurt and yogurt with oats\u002Fgranola, and of course coffee, orange juice and water. Couple of waffle makers in there too. Staff in the breakfast area are always extremely courteous as well, and though the hotel is usually pretty full, I think I may have only found myself out of a table once.\n\nThe hotel has a pool and gym, which I've never explored, and an attached Keg steakhouse, which also does room service. One of the neat things about the hotel is it has theme or \""social\"" nights Monday - Wednesday I believe, where they have different food in the lobby for free - ranges from nachos to hamburgers, to a \""dessert\"" night with coconut cream pie and brownies, etc. with cans of pop, sparkling water and cookies (which I might add, are also pretty good for \""free hotel cookies\"" after coming back from work).\n\nOne negative thing that needs to be updated is the Wi-Fi hotspot system (iBAHN) in the hotel. While the range and speed is good, getting connected usually takes me about 10 minutes of messing around in different browsers, the hotspot system where you have to go to first (and again every 24 hours on the nose), is really outdated (guessing from the early 2000s) - it won't even open in Google Chrome or Firefox because of the outdated security of the webpage that those browsers blocks, and even in Internet Explorer, it can be a bit finicky to bring up and get connected. Kind of begs the question if the system is still secure nowadays - I use a VPN for work, so no worries, but something to consider if you're doing any online banking, etc. Really like to see them upgrade that system while doing their other renovations. Obviously a minor, but a bit annoying thing in a hotel that's otherwise pretty great. In some of rooms I've noticed a wired connection option too, usually near the dining table.\n\nWhat also makes this hotel really shine is the staff - I already mentioned the breakfast area staff, but the front desk staff are truly the best I've seen. Always extremely pleasant, and ready to help in any way. They're all quick to offer their opinions on some of the many places to eat around, and give driving directions (and a map if you still use one). Check-in and out is always very efficient, and again, super friendly and pleasant. While they're all great, Ingrid (hopefully spelling that right!) at the front desk always stands out as friendly face to see, checks me in from memory, and is ready for a chat, recommendations, etc. \n\nParking is ample, and while I've never been without a spot, I've come close before, but is generally pretty good - they also have a covered section underneath, which is great in the winter months for the experienced traveller who might leave their car there for a couple of days if you're working right downtown (no snow brushing!).\n\nPrice of the hotel is very reasonable for this quality of hotel, between the room size, amenities and staff it's definitely a winner. Highly recommended!",5,positive

Mattress is quite uncomfortable as its very hard. Air conditioning is quite weak and loud.

Honestly during booking on Expedia no where was it mentioned that there was a fee for parking... not until the very end after payment was complete and receipt was issued in my email that then a parking fee was made known. If I would have known of this parking fee, we wouldn't have stayed here as its basically going to cost us like $45.00 to park our car during our stay. I think hotel parking should just be something that comes along with the room as the price of the room itself is quite a lot. Just another money grab. Also... what sold us on booking here was the picture of a hot tub in the pool area. We usually go to a local hotel that has a slide but we thought this time we'd trade the hotel with the slide for one with a hot tub... another big let down as when we went this evening to enjoy the hot tub... it wasn't working...no jets.

You get a kitchen with full-size fridge, dish washer, microwave and stovetop as well as dishes\u002Fpots\u002Fpans.  They even throw in a bag of microwave popcorn for your enjoyment.  The kitchen area also has a dining table.  \n\nThere is also a business table that you can set up a computer on easily.  The sofabed is more of a high-class settee than a regular utilitarian sofa.  The king-sized bed is very comfortable and the lighting is great throughout.  \n\nBreakfast the next morning was fantastic!  There is a great selection of food, like they have at most hotels with cereal, breads, bagels, english muffins for toasting as well as fruit and yogurt and juice and coffee.  Where this hotel excels is with the eggs, sausages, hash browns and the potential to make yourself a breakfast wrap.  There are also cookies for offer.  There was such a great selection of food that I'm sure I'm forgetting quite a bit.  And staff keep the kitchen area spotless.  \n\nThere were only 2 drawbacks, but the benefits more than make up for the drawbacks.  Number 1 is that there was no bathtub in the room, for a bath - but there was a giant walk-in shower.  Number 2 is the $10 parking fee that the hotel charges - but with the great deal I got from priceline, I'm certainly not complaining!",5,positive

I recently spent 6 nights at the Rod Moncton hotel and resorts at 434 Main Street, Moncton, NB E1C 1B9. From July 22,2014 to July 28,2014. It was the greatest experience that I could\u2019ve had at a hotel. Four other friends of mine stayed at this hotel as well. We were greeted with fast, friendly service. We felt welcome\nWe spoke to Janet Higgins who was able to provide us with a group rate that beat other competitor hotels in the area hands down. which made stay at the Rodd a no brainer. We were also able to have all of our rooms next to each other because the hotel manager, Danny, ensured his guests were happy. He was kind and helpful because whenever we had an issue, Danny ensured he was on top of it and always had a solution. The cleaning staff was amazing always having our room clean and never disturbing us. They were accommodating to all of our needs. Only two of the four rooms had refrigerators in them and this was a problem for us. Donald the maintenance worker took care of this and put refrigerators in the two rooms that did not have them. We were very appreciative of this and it made our stay enjoyable. The newly renovated hotel was clean and the new beds were very comfortable to sleep on. All the money they spent on the renovations was well spent. On our second day, the hotel manager was kind enough to give my friends and I a room to store our hockey equipment in. This ensured our belongings were safe. The complimentary breakfast was great every morning. They even had a pool that was nice to swim in. The hotel has great restaurant recommendations. A restaurant they recommended was called Catch 22. It was a fantastic place. When looking up hotels to stay in and reading reviews, I saw small complaints like the bathrooms were too small but they were not.They were a good size and nicely renovated. I can\u2019t find anything bad to say about this hotel. Tammy who is the General Manager of the hotel made sure our stay was pleasant and that we were happy.

It was a chaotic weekend with a huge concert at Magnetic Hill and the Rodd Moncton exceeded our expectations in both customer service and accommodations.  The room was very quiet and the bed was amazing (and we sleep on a Tempurpedic mattress at home so I'm very picky).  It's a small hotel and not flashy but matched our needs perfectly for the time we were there.  The staff went above and beyond with every interaction and even offered a pack a \""to go\"" breakfast for our very early flight since we couldn't make the continental breakfast.  The hotel was completely booked but never felt crowded or full and is adjacent to a lovely river walk and amenities.  I will not review the Howard Johnson on their page because we didn't stay there ultimately but they do not have good customer service.  I was leery of staying there because of trip advisor reviews so I changed my reservation several weeks ahead of time.  I booked online, a refundable room, and had confirmation to that affect but they only issued a partial refund after many hours on the phone to several staff members (who were very helpful).  They insisted I booked a room that required full payment despite cancellation even though I booked at a higher rate to keep a refundable rate.  The entire experience was very upsetting and I would avoid that hotel because the management is entirely uninterested in customer service.  Even though I paid a penalty for cancellation, I'm relieved our weekend wasn't ruined by risking further issues with management and we were able to have a great time in Moncton.  Just beware.

The room was VERY SMALL, the bed was a small double. The bathroom looked like it was last done in the 70's, and the window had mold on it. There was basic cable, no movie options to pick from or even to rent. The pool area was pretty nice, but we did not stay to long, as there were a few people in the pool who clearly had one to many alcohol beverages and were swearing and talking foolishly, even while there were children around.\nThe \""Hot breakfast\"" was the absolute worst! I actually thought it had to be a joke. You got 3 options...1 being a drink and muffin, which I actually wish I had picked that option now that I know what the hot breakfast was. Option two was cereal and a drink. The option I assume most people would choose was eggs, toast, bacon or sausage and home fries....But...seriously when it came out I wanted to laugh. Our juice came in a glass that was no bigger than a shot glass..the eggs were so runny, I could have used a spoon, the toast was cold and dry and the hashbrowns  were not fresh cut and tasted like they were heated in a microwave. We got 1 strip of bacon and I know it was still half raw! We left and went to Tim Hortons.\nAnother thing was the noise at night, the parking lot was very busy, a lot of loud people yelling outside, alarms on cars going off, and loud people in the hallways coming and going all hours of the night. I recommend you NOT stay at this hotel. Not worth the money. The pictures and details online are not what they say.",2,negative

Do not let the pretty pictures fool you, it is ready now. Let\u2019s start off with the pool; the towels were sized perfectly for my 1 year old, this is not an exaggeration. Any normal human being would require at least 5 of these towels to get dry, on its own this wouldn\u2019t be a big deal, but it is the smallest (pun) of all the problems this hotel has. Apparently, the hot tub stopped working many months ago and they have no intent of fixing it. When we entered the pool area, we where warned by some small children not to go in because it- #1-smelled funny, #2-the water was foggy and weird looking, #3- there was lots of dry skin chunks floating around in it. None of this would be the biggest deal if the hot tub wasn\u2019t directly connected to the pool\u2026the water splashes back and fourth between the two, lovely. Third pool problem, the dome that covers the pool sounds nice in theory but in reality, there appears to be no air exchange or de-humidification system working. You can\u2019t see out of the dome because of the condensation which is molding and turning colors around the edges, sometimes if you\u2019re really lucky, it drips down on you while you sit by the pool. The fourth largest problem with the pool is that it burns your eyes and nose to be in the pool area. Not when you are in the water, when you sit by the pool it is literally hard to see and breath, again I suspect due to improper air movement. The remainder of the hotel looks like it is from the 1970s but someone made everything \u201Cnew\u201D by painting it with 50 coats of paint. Not just the walls, but the tiles, the toilets, the toilet seat, the bathtub, and some of the fixtures. It looks exactly how you\u2019d imagine and the workmanship in some areas it not great. The tile work in the bathroom wasn't what I would call professional, or the laminating of the various surfaces, or the hanging of the towel bar which was likely 2\u201D off level. Further bathroom problems= The door is very small, luckily, we aren\u2019t large people and didn\u2019t bring any large family because there must very literally be times when patrons can\u2019t fit through the door. It definitely was a closet at one point that was later made a bathroom. When you get inside the bathroom, you\u2019ll notice-#1-The toilet seat is peeling and discolored #2- The laminate on the countertop is peeling away. #3-The tub is not very deep. #4 the faucet drips. #5 The toilet is so small that if you are man you will have to decide which business you want to do at what point in time because you can\u2019t fit to do both. #6- despite the hotel being almost empty, the shower water temperature fluctuates greatly from ice cold to scalding hot. If you can get over all of this, and actually stay to use the bathroom (like I did), then hopefully like me, you don\u2019t have to fix the toilet after using it. I had to reach inside the back of the toilet and re-connect the chain to the flapper. I\u2019d bet money that the cover on the top of my toilet was not actually from my toilet because it didn\u2019t appear to fit correctly. The rooms have great big windows which is awesome but like the pool, there is no air exchange system, so they are just a solid film of foggy condensation. In fact, there is so much condensation that it creates large pools at the bottom of the window which eventually runs down off the window sill and onto the floor. I commend the house keepers because they do a good job at removing the mold and cleaning the surfaces. I admit, I didn\u2019t see any mold in the rooms but with the amount of water build up it, must be happening. I\u2019ve stayed at many hotels all over the World, but I\u2019ve never stayed in one with double beds. To be fair, they do advertise it but it\u2019s not something you go out of your way to check for, you just assume most hotels will have at least a queen-sized bed. The TV is a flat screen, but it is likely one of the very first examples, which is fine for me but I note it for others who might care. The hotel also appears to rent out their parking lot when there are hockey games across the street. Luckily, we did not have trouble finding a spot, but it would have been the icing on the cake had we had to park down the block. The staff seemed nice and the flooring in the main room was nice but it does need some serious work. You could look over some of these problems had it been cheaper, but we could have stayed at the Crown across the street for $9 more. I try not to complain but some of these are substantial problems. I\u2019m confident that this hotel would not pass a building inspection in its current state. I respect the ownership for their plans to demo the hotel and rebuild it into something great again, they themselves know it is due and I suspect none of this review will be news to them. However, I don\u2019t think they should wait, it is due now and if they do decide to put it off for a few more months, the rates need to be adjusted accordingly. I like their branding and some of the concepts but the hotel needs work.",2,negative

First - it's not really free you either get to choose from the 1 egg breakfast Or some small muffin\u002Fcereal options, you are expected to pay a tip. Second - if you don't want one of these small breakfast items your voucher is worth $7. The $7 pretty much gets you nothing as the resteraunt breakfast is extremely overpriced for what you get.

It does have a motel feel in the sense the lower rooms still have a screened and heavy locking door to the parking lot, but aside from that the renovations are quite nice. The hotel itself is situated a 5-7 walk to the downtown core and the parking lot is large. We were in room 110 if my memory serves me right (deluxe queen) which was tastefully re-decorated with sleek furniture and a wonderful grey and green color pallet. As with previous reviews, the bathroom is a little on the small side but functions quite well. The A\u002FC unit is situated above the exterior door and was very loud, and although I normally don't mind the sound of those units, this was loud even by my standards, but it did feature a remote which was nice. The bed itself was quite comfortable but I found the pillows to be a little on the harder side. I couldn't really hear other people in other rooms but we were situated across from the maid\u002Flaundry room but were never awoken in the morning but any noise\n\nThe pool was on the first floor and it was indoor but seemed to have a retractable roof to allow some natural light and air in - that's a nice touch. The pool is on the smaller side but does have  pedestals in the deep end (think swim up bar down south style) so you could sit in the water while talking to someone sun bathing.\n\nThe restaurant was something we tried in the morning since it included a free hot breakfast, but when we stopped in at 9:30am the next morning, the server informed us they had no food as their delivery truck didn't arrive. There was no offer of tea\u002Fcoffee\u002Fjuice so it was a little shocking considering there were two couples finishing up their meals. Upon check out we mentioned this to the staff person working (Eric I believe) and he was quite surprised and offered us a $10 discount on our stay. He also explained that they didn't own the restaurant but rather purchased the meals at a rate so it was  nice to have an explanation to understand the situation a little better.\n\nOverall I think it was a great stay and would definitely consider coming back.

We could complain that there were only scrambled eggs, no sunny side up etc, but we like scrambled and really that complaint was just too funny. I also loved the view, watching golfers bumbling about  doing golf things, amusing and relaxing. The common room areas were welcoming and  one could relax there or out on the extensive decking looking at the diverse plants, lots of roses (rugosa) and daylilies, listening to birds, including chickens. We didn't eat at the restaurant, I can't recall whether there was one, but the host recommended an interesting dining place down the road where we had a good meal. All in all, a comfortable and pleasing place to stay, and I highly recommend it, especially if you like interesting attractive vistas",5,positive

Anyone who was in the Moncton area at that time can guess what happened next. The one-night stay ended up being a three-night stay, thanks to the \""Storm of the Century\"".\n\nWe stayed in two different rooms in the older part of the Inn, so I can't speak to the quality of the newer, fancier rooms\u002Fsuites. The older rooms are tastefully decorated and large enough to be comfortable and not claustrophobic like some Inns I have stayed in. The beds aren't the most comfortable I have ever slept in, but not as bad as many I have slept in. All of the furniture is a antique-ish and the bedside tables in the second room we stayed in seemed quite fragile. The bathrooms are clean and modern, but the water pressure is lacking a bit and it can take quite some time to get hot water out of the sink faucet. The TVs are quite small (around 24\""), which normally isn't an issue for me, but we were snowbound for a couple of days so a larger TV with more than basic cable would have been nice. The free high-speed WiFi helped because I was able to access Netflix on my tablet and phone to help ease the boredom. Breakfast was simple but tasty: Scrambled eggs, bacon\u002Fsausage, toast, coffee\u002Ftea, fruit juice, yogurt, fresh fruit. The Inn normally serves only breakfast, but it's close to the city and there's a bistro and a sushi place quite close to the Inn that offer a discount to Inn guests.\n\nThere are two reasons for me giving this facility a 5-star rating, even though I did do some nitpicking in my previous paragraph: (1) the normal rate for the older rooms we stayed in is already relatively inexpensive and a decent value, but the owners discounted our rate further because we were stuck there due to the storm. (2) the owners of the Inn are two of the nicest people you will ever meet.\n\nThey are very gracious hosts. They were ever so apologetic for us being snowbound at the Inn, even though it was obviously beyond their control. They apologized repeatedly, called the Department of Transportation numerous times to try to get the road cleared so we could leave, and even paid a neighbour with a tractor-mounted snowblower to try to clear the road enough for us to get out and would not allow us to chip in a few bucks for the bill (the neighbour also ended up declining payment). When it turned out the snow was too much even for the neighbour's machine, the owners again apologized. Even though they are only equipped and stocked to serve breakfast, they did their best to feed us each night we were stranded, again apologizing that it wasn't a three-course meal.\n\nI can think of worse places to be stranded for a couple of extra nights and I can think of worse people to be stranded with. The Auberge Wild Rose Inn is a quaint B&B-style Inn that is great value, in a good location, with spectacular owners. My wife and I will probably return to the Inn and try one of the newer suites with a whirlpool tub, but I think we'll do it in the summer. ;)",5,positive

The place is spotlessly clean, has spacious rooms and is not far from Moncton. Having said that, here are the highlights of our experience: there are no carpets on the floors or stairs, and the walls are paper thin - you can hear EVERYTHING. For us, this meant listening to the owner's kid playing and squealing in the house, music playing in the downstairs restaurant, our neighbours chatting and packing up for their 4 AM check-out and clattering down the uncarpeted stairs, and every metalic thud of the industrial locks on the bedroom doors. Meanwhile, our room was blazing hot at night with no thermostat to control ourselves. We literally stripped down, threw off the sheets, put up the windows and blinds (not so great since the inn is L-shaped, if you know what I mean!) and sweltered the night away. We also heard the 12:30 AM and 2 AM thundering of a near-by train blaring it's horn and rattling the room. Then, to top things off, the alarm clock next door went off at 7 am with nobody there to turn it off. I finally went and sunk into a bath to both cool down and shut out the noise. My hubby called the front to ask them to turn off the alarm that continued to ring though the wall. After 35 MINUTES he had to call down a second time. Further, upon check-in you have to tell them what time you want breakfast, as in no leisurely wake-up when you want to -who wants to be on a schedule on holidays?! Breakfast included cold scrambled eggs and a container of yogurt. We were both exhausted the next morning. We could not wait to leave. (Oh, and the wireless internet never did work for us.) Upon check-out I sought out the owner to speak to him about his \""100% satisfaction guarantee\"", but I could not find him anywhere. All I could find was a painter who had propped his ladder up against our bedroom window area - this happened even before we had left for breakfast. I did complete a comment form leaving both positive and negative comments, as well as recommendations for consideration. I left my email address for future communication since I could not find anyone to talk to. To date I have never heard from the Inn and we have been billed the full amount owing. So, there you go.

We decided we did not want the usual cookie cutter chain hotel and found this Inn on line. We took a chance and were delighted with our stay. Dennis and Regina were courteous and helpful. I stayed with one sister in a king suite room and We were more than pleased with the comfort, size of room and decor. The Inn is located slightly north of Moncton but we found it easily in the countryside. The room had a jacuzzi bath, terry robes, gas fireplace, cable tv, coffee, water, plus a nice breakfast. We would return there anytime. It was rainy and not summer yet and it looks like the gardens would be beautiful in another month.",5,positive

We were upgraded to an Executive Suite from Standard, we had booked on-line and unsure of what we were receiving but the price selected was very good for a busy weekend in Moncton which generally drives up hotel prices. I loved the hardwood floors, no dust to aggravate allergies. The room was fantastic, a lovely size, we weren't on top of each other. We loved the homeyness feel! The older furniture and knick knacks, assured us we were in the right place very comforting, something we enjoy in our own home, Grandmas wash stand, tables and doilies. Breakfast was great, we were served which we are not use to, generally buffet. After reading through more of the reviews, I see the owners entertain Park 'n Fly - awesome. We will stay again, so glad we have found this Inn a great winter getaway spot.",5,positive

The golf view rooms, and the front dining room look directly at two of the greens. \nWe opted to upgrade to a suite for an extra $15 when we got there, which gave us a garden view room with our own balcony, and private entry from the outside. \nThe owners were very nice people, and very helpful where we were out of town. The only issue we had was trying to find a food place to deliver to the hotel (it is just outside town limits) but the owner was able to provide some names of restaurants that do deliver. \nBreakfast was delicious, some of the best scrambled eggs I've ever had. There are chickens that roam the property, and provide fresh eggs. There was also a nice selection of fresh fruit, coffee, cereal, juice, etc.\nOur room was excellent, very nice and clean. There was an air conditioner\u002Fheater, propane fire place, and a jet tub. The bed was comfortable, and we had a nice view of the back garden. There is a train that passes by every once in a while, but with the air conditioner on you weren't able to hear it.\nWe found it to be very central, even though it is outside of town. The mall, liquor store, restaurants, and Royal Oaks are all about a 10 minute drive away on the highway. It was nice to not have to stay right in the city, and worry about parking, but still be so close to everything. \n\nAll in all we will definitely be returning to the Wild Rose Inn, I highly recommend for a weekend away. It is especially great if you're planning on playing some golf since it is pretty central to most courses in Moncton, and is a great price for the amount of hospitality you receive. We felt right at home, and had an excellent stay.",5,positive
